# OAuth2.0-Playground

The OAuth2.0- Playground app is a sample application that can be used to Simulate and Test the OpenID Connect flow using any Identity Provider that suits our requirement. The Authorization of this application can be done via the IDP itself whereas it uses OAuth2.0 as the protocol.

This application is currently being implemented by the WSO2, to test simulations on the WSO2 Identity Server so that it can demonstrate many security implementations including OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect. This code has been taken from the <a href="http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/carbon/platform/branches/turing/products/is/5.0.0/modules/samples/oauth2/playground2/">here</a> and it has been modified by me and uploaded as a directly usable repository for my demonstration on OpenID Connect using the WSO2. 

To get a better understanding on where this can be used, please visit my <a href="http://keetmalin.wixsite.com/keetmalin/single-post/2016/11/17/OpenID-Connect-with-WSO2-Identity-Server">Blog</a>
